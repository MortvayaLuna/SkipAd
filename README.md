Hello :), if u're tired of these annoying ads from YouTube, i have the soluction.
Yt are now blocking the ads blocks, so we can't just actvate these extensions
anymore. But, by the grace of Deus Machina and your blessed lenguage 
(aka Javascript) we can do it just automatizing the act of skip the ads :D. Btw,
just follow the steps:

1- U'll need the extension Tampermonkey. U can add by following the url
https://www.tampermonkey.net/ and follow the steps

2- Go to the file SkipAd.js and copy the code

3- Open the extension config and click in "Add new script"

4- Paste the code in the Tampermonkey window and click ctrl+S on your keyboard 
to save the script

And thats it :), u can now watch videos free of ads.
